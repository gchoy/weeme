# WeeMe

Web application built for mobile first that allows users to input their current location, and find nearby public / free-access bathrooms. The user can see each each bathroom's rating, and true or false values regarding each bathroom's: family friendliness, gender neutrality, and accessibility.

If users would like to add a bathroom or new location (building / park / center / residence), they may create an account.
